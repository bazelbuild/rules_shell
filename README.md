# Bazel `rules_shell`

[`rules_shell`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_shell) is an experimental Bazel ruleset maintained by the Bazel team that enables modern, hermetic support for writing Bazel targets using shell scripts.

---

## Purpose

The goal of `rules_shell` is to make working with shell scripts in Bazel more robust and reproducible, similar to how Bazel handles other languages like Go (`rules_go`) or Python (`rules_python`).

---

## Key Features

- **Hermetic `sh_binary` and `sh_test` rules**
  - Declare and manage script dependencies explicitly
  - Scripts only access files and tools declared as inputs

- **Shell toolchain support**
  - Customizable shell interpreter (e.g., specific `bash` version)
  - Cross-platform support via toolchain configuration

- **Reproducibility and sandboxing**
  - Ensures scripts only access declared inputs
  - Improves remote caching and build determinism

---

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a shell binary using `rules_shell`:

```python
load("@rules_shell//shell:defs.bzl", "sh_binary")

sh_binary(
    name = "hello",
    srcs = ["hello.sh"],
    data = [":greeting.txt"],
    deps = ["@bash//:bin/bash"],
)
```

## Dependancies

Please note that rules_shell depends on bash outside of the Bazel sandbox

```
_DEFAULT_SHELL_PATHS = {
    "windows": "c:/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe",
    "linux": "/bin/bash",
    "osx": "/bin/bash",
    "freebsd": "/usr/local/bin/bash",
    "openbsd": "/usr/local/bin/bash",
}
```
